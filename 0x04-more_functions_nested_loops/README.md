0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops.
(A project work containing c  files on functions and loops).
instructions:
* Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
*You are allowed to use _putchar.
*You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

Task:
(1)Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
Returns 1 if c is uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise

(2)Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a digit
Returns 0 otherwise

(3)Write a function that multiplies two integers.

Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

(4)Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

NOTE: These are just few out of the the fifteen task contained in this project
