* Project Title: 0x08. C - Recursion
* Requirements: 
	1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	3. All your files should end with a new line
	4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
	5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	6. You are not allowed to use global variables
	7. No more than 5 functions per file
	8. You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
	9. You are allowed to use _putchar
	10. You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
	12. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to 		 push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c fi		les might be different from the one shown in the example
	13. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called mai		 n.h
	14. Don’t forget to push your header file
	15. You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
	16. You are not allowed to use static variables
* Task:
	0. she locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
		Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
		* Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s)
		FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
		Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursing
			File: 0-puts_recursion.c
	1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
		Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
		* Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
		Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursion
			File: 1-print_rev_recursion.c
	2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
		Write a function that returns the length of a string.
		* Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
		FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.
		Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursion
			File: 2-strlen_recursion.c
	3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
		Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
		* Prototype: int factorial(int n);
		If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
		Factorial of 0 is 1
		Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursion
			File: 3-factorial.c
	4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
		Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
		* Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
		If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
		Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursion
			File: 4-pow_recursion.c
	5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
		Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
		* Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
		If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
		 Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursion
			File: 5-sqrt_recursion.c
	6. Inception. Is it possible?
		Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
		* Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);
		Repo:
			GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
			Directory: 0x08-recursion
			File: 6-is_prime_number.c
